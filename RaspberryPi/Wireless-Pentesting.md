# Wireless Pentesting with a Raspberry Pi 4 and Kali Linux
## Requirements
- Needed
  - Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB, 4GB or 8GB)
  - Micro SD card (Minimal 16GB, preferably 32GB+)
  - [Raspberry Pi Imager software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) (You can also download Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi manually and install it to a micro SD card, but I prefer to use the imager software provided by Raspberry Pi, as it already includes the latest Kali Linux images)
  - Ethernet cable with internet connection (We will use the built-in WiFi for setting up an access point)
- Optional
  - Monitor with micro HDMI connection (Only for local setup)
  - USB keyboard and mouse (Only for local setup)
  - USB WiFi adapter (Preferably one that is supported with Linux in-kernel drivers, please refer to [this amazing GitHub from morrownr](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi/blob/main/home/USB_WiFi_Adapters_that_are_supported_with_Linux_in-kernel_drivers.md) for more in-depth knowledge on USB WiFi adapters and their chipsets)

## Initial setup
Use the Raspberry Pi Imager tool to flash Kali Linux (preferably 32-bit, as it gets more testing) to the micro SD card.
Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, as any other software installation on the Pi, and connect it to a power source and let it boot for 1-2 minutes.

> Be aware that the default Kali Linux image for Raspberry Pi has SSH enabled and uses the default kali:kali credentials.
