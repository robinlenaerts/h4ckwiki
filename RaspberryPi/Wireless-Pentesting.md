# Wireless Pentesting with a Raspberry Pi 4 and Kali Linux
## Requirements
- Needed
  - Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB, 4GB or 8GB)
  - Micro SD card (Minimal 16GB, preferably 32GB+)
  - [Raspberry Pi Imager software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) (You can also download Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi manually and install it to a micro SD card, but I prefer to use the imager software provided by Raspberry Pi, as it already includes the latest Kali Linux images)
  - Ethernet cable with internet connection (We will use the built-in WiFi for setting up an access point)
- Optional
  - Monitor with micro HDMI connection (For local setup)
  - USB keyboard and mouse (For local setup)
  - USB WiFi adapter (Preferably one that is supported with Linux in-kernel drivers, please refer to [this amazing GitHub from morrownr](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi/blob/main/home/USB_WiFi_Adapters_that_are_supported_with_Linux_in-kernel_drivers.md) for more in-depth knowledge on USB WiFi adapters and their chipsets)
